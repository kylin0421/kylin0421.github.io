Matthew effect is everywhere. Considering academia, the top labs and companies have sufficient resources, publish more and more papers every year and attract more and more new talents. While the smaller ones struggle to meet all of its researchers' needs for GPUs, and eventually they lose talents.

This is normal and somewhat inevitable. What I want to say is, for people at small institutions (no disrespect to SZTE and there are many nice and wonderful people here, yet it's scale is small and resources are really limited which makes me to write this blog now), it's harder to publish with the limited resources (both human and computational) and thus harder to compete with people from more prestigious places.

I'll be lying if I say I'm dumb, but I'm not a genius either. Therefore the same dilemma applies to me as well. I enjoy exploring and trying out ideas, and sometimes I can achieve some meaningful results (at least I believe so) that could translate to publications at solid venues. However, my current resources hardly support this now. I tried to reach out and did get some replies, though none of them gave me access to resources to the extent that I wished.

I'll keep doing what needs to be done, pushing where I can, and see where this path leads.
